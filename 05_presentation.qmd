## Research Question

**Does energy efficiency affect rental prices?**

-   **Motivation:** Increasing energy costs and climate regulations.
-   **Hypothesis:** Efficient apartments (A+, A, B) command a price premium ("Green Premium").
-   **Method:** Hedonic regression on ImmoScout24 data.

## Descriptive Evidence

![Rent Distribution by Energy Class](output/figures/png/fig01_boxplot_raw.png){width=90%}

-   **Observation:** Rent tends to be higher for efficient classes (A+/A).
-   **Caveat:** Raw data does not control for location or size.

## The Green Premium (Results)

-   **Result:** Significant premium for Classes A+, A, and B relative to Class C.
-   **Discount:** Inefficient classes (F, G, H) trade at a discount.

## Urban vs. Rural Markets

![Interaction Effects](output/figures/png/fig03_interaction_effect.png){width=90%}

-   **Urban (Red):** Steep premium for efficiency.
-   **Rural (Green):** Flatter curve; efficiency matters less.
-   **Conclusion:** The "Green Premium" is stronger in cities.

## Conclusion

1.  **Energy Efficiency Matters:** It is capitalized into rental prices.
2.  **Market Heterogeneity:** The effect is driven largely by urban markets.
3.  **Policy Implication:** Decarbonization incentives work differently in cities vs. countryside.
